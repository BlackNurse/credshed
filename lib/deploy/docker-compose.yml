### ELASTIC GUIDLINES FOR MULTIPLE NODES ON ONE HOST ###

# Max heap size for each node instance should be < 32Gb
# Leave 50% of the memory to file system cache for Lucene
# Lower "node.processors" to make room for other containers
# Keep in mind that multiple nodes also means that network connections, OS file descriptors, mmap file limits, will also be shared between the nodes
